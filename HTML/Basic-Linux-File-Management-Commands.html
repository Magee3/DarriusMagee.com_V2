            This is a useful tip for system admins we will examine local configuration files to get an idea of user accounts, group accounts, security settings,
            and other basic configuration information on your systems.

            We will display and search a log file using various commands. We will also create a directory structure and populate with files using the touch command.

            Before we do anything we first want to switch into a user whos log we want to view. In this case we will view "user1"s logs.

    </div>

    <div class="write-up-text">

            We will read the dnf.log file located in /var/log. The dnf.log contains package information, timestamps. repository information, error messages and more.
             This file contains a long list of logs, to long to just read and find what you want with just your eyes. We can view the first few lines of any files
              with the "head" command.
        </p>

            As you see we get a few lines of logs, mainly just debugging information. We can also review the most recent logs or logs at the 
            end by using the "tail" command.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="write-up-text">

        <h1>Stage 2: Use filter commands to make log analysis easier</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="write-up-text">
        <p>
            The grep command matches strings of characters, making it useful to search for specific items in a 
            long list. We will be viewing user2's logs for this example.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="write-up-text">
        <p>
            Run: cat /var/log/dnf.log | grep "timer"

    <div class="project_images"> <img src="../images/Thumbnails/Basic Linux File Management Commands/Pt.4.png"> </div>

    <div class="write-up-text">
        <p>
            As you see any log that contains the string "timer" will populate our terminal. You can also add the " -i " switch 
            for grep to remove case sensitivity.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="write-up-text">
        <p>
            Run: cat /var/log/dnf.log | grep -i "fail"
        </p>

    <div class="project_images"> <img src="../images/Thumbnails/Basic Linux File Management Commands/Pt.5.png"> </div>


    <div class="write-up-text">
        <p>
            As you can see even any string with "fail" are populated. It is a good habbit to add the " -i " switch when grepping 
            because you may miss something you didn't know existed.

    <div class="write-up-text">
        <p>
            We will go over copying files, we will be using user1's account. We will copy the /opt/files to our home directory.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="write-up-text">
        <p>
            Run: cp -R /opt/files ~ (the -R switch copies everything in the folder files, subfolders, etc. The ~ is the home directory)

    <div class="write-up-text">
        <p>
            We then moved into the files location and viewed it contents. It is good practice to type ls after every movement, or manipulation 
            of files to make sure it is doing what you told it to do.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can create new directories and able to copy files into them using a terminal. To make a directory use the "mkdir" command.

    </div>

    <div class="write-up-text">

    <div class="write-up-text">
        <p>

        <p>
            You can also create blank files by using the "touch" command.
