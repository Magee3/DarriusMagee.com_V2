            First and foremost, let's retrieve crucial information about the computer we are currently using, specifically the DC10 workstation, 
            which serves as the domain controller. We will proceed by executing the following three commands to obtain the IP address, MAC address, 
            and other relevant information:

            Next, we will proceed to test our connections with other devices and retrieve information from them as well. 
            To accomplish this, we will employ the "Ping" command to check the connectivity, and we will utilize Wireshark to monitor the network traffic.

            ARP = Address Resolution Protocol, this protocol enables us to obtain both the MAC and IP addresses associated with the

    <div class="write-up-text">

            ICMP = Internet Control Message Protocol, we can access valuable information related to ping requests and their associated details. This protocol enables us to gather

            We are now on a workstation that is on a business environment. Lets see if the PC is a client of a DHCP server.

            We can see that the PC is a DHCP client and is running perfectly fine. We will now simulate a DHCP failure. In our DC we will go to our servers

        <p>
            If you notice that the newly assigned IP address is in a format known as Automatic Private IP Address (APIPA), it indicates that the 
            DHCP server may be down or the PC is unable to reach the DHCP service. APIPA is a feature in Windows that allows devices to assign 
            themselves an IP address in the range of 169.254.0.1 to 169.254.255.254 when they fail to obtain a valid IP address from a DHCP server.

    </div>

    <div class="write-up-text">
        <p>        
            To resolve the issue, let's switch back to the DC10 Workstation and reactivate the DHCP service. After restarting the service, you can repeat the mentioned steps 
            to obtain a new IP address. This will ensure that the PC can successfully communicate with the DHCP server and acquire a valid IP configuration.

    <div class="write-up-text">

            We will utilize Nmap, a network scanning tool that enables the discovery of hosts and services on a computer network. By sending packets and analyzing the resulting responses, 
            Nmap provides valuable insights into the network's structure and the services running on it.

        <p>
            In the GUI version of Nmap, you have the convenience of selecting the desired type of scan by simply clicking on the available options. This user-friendly interface allows for easy 
            customization of the scan parameters. Additionally, the GUI version provides the flexibility to manually enter commands similar to working with a Linux operating system, enabling more advanced users to have precise control over the scanning process.

    <div class="write-up-text">
        <p>
            After running Nmap, we can observe that it has provided us with both the IP and MAC addresses, as well as information about open ports and associated services. Based on the results, we can determine that a total of 11 ports are open. Furthermore, we 
            can make an assumption that this might be a messaging server due to the presence of open ports 25 and 143, which are commonly used for email (SMTP) and IMAP services, respectively.

    <div class="write-up-text">
        <p>
            In Nmap we are not limited to just one target. We can also target an entire network. We will do a "Quick Scan" on "10.1.16.0/24"

            We have received the same information as in the previous scan, along with the count of active hosts. This count gives us an overview of the number of responsive devices on the network. However, it's important to note that our exploration 
            with Nmap has only scratched the surface of its capabilities. The tool's power becomes evident as we delve deeper into its features and functionalities. Nmap is undeniably an essential and indispensable tool that should be present in every professional's toolbox, given its remarkable potency and versatility.

            You will observe that it is not possible to directly analyze SSH packets over a wireframe. The reason for this is that these packets are encrypted 
            and cannot be deciphered without the appropriate key. This emphasizes the significance of encryption, as it acts as a protective measure against 
            unauthorized individuals intercepting and accessing sensitive information.
