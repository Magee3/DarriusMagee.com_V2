            We are acting as Kali4 and our target is App1. Our networks are segmented but, our routers share a 
            common switch. Our goal is to get our target to send us a shell, this is called a reverse shell.

    <div class="write-up-text">
        <p>
            The first step in attacking a target is recon. RECON RECON RECON. We can't attack something we do not 
            know. We will be using the popular recon tool nmap on our targeted IP.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="write-up-text">
        <p>
            This is optional but, you can create a file with a list of IP's and tell nmap to scan the list using the " -iL " switch.

            The " tee " command allows you to run whatever command you want and print the output to a file. Whatever you put after 
            tee will become the file name.

            As you see ports 53/DNS and 80/HTTP are open. It is safe to assume that App1 is a webserver since DNS and HTTP are 
            open. We will most likely attack port 80/HTTP but, lets find some more information. When you see a target is 
            hosting HTTP think BROWSER BROWSER BROWSER. Type the targets IP into your browser.

            We found something!!! This is a $1 vulnerability, D Tier, common, but it's something. The vulnerability is 
            "Version Disclosure Vulnerability". We now know that App1 is a Linux server running on Apache version 2.4.52. 
            This is a low vulnerability but, this is a step in finding exploits against the server. I mean you can try it 
            your self. Copy and paste this in google:

            We are still trying to gather more information on the site. The last thing we will do is search 
            to see if there are any hidden paths in the site. After all, websites are directories, files, 
            media, and code. We will run dirbuster to find any hidden paths.

            It appears we are at an application in which we can search files if we give the website proper credentials. We know 
            that the machine we are dealing with is a Linux Debian. Let's see if we can insert linux commands into the webapp.

            Linux, Microsoft, HTML, RUBY, etc runs on code. When injecting code use functions that will close a code so you can 
            start your own. For example, if you look at HTML code you can see a pattern of &lt;> "" etc. These are used to close 
            comment make references etc. These should be something to foucs on if you are injecting a html service. We are 
            assuming the application allows us to talk to the linux server directly. So we will use functions such as " ; & | 
            " etc.
