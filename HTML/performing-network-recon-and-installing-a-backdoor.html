            Reconnaissance, often referred to as "recon," is a critical phase in cybersecurity that involves gathering 
            information about a target system or network. It plays a vital role in understanding the vulnerabilities, 
            weaknesses, and potential attack vectors that adversaries might exploit. It is also the first step in the
            MITRE ATT&CK framework.

            Our kali machine is on the network we are performing recon on. We are gathering IP's of all the devices including
            our own. There are multiple ways to gather this information just like a math problem. Personally my goal is to
            gather all the information without having to ask or move from my desk. So lets see what we can do.

In summary, this exercise involved investigating an unfamiliar network using various tools to acquire and document its layout. We then focused on investigating a 
web server, followed by testing its security features against malware that installs a remote backdoor. Finally, we successfully closed the backdoor, effectively 
eliminating the potential risk of unauthorized access. Through this exercise, we enhanced the network's security and emphasized the importance of proactive 
measures to mitigate vulnerabilities.
