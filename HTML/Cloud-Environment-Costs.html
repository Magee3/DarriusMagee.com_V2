            We figure out how you will estimate cloud virtual machine operations expenses for an organization. We will be using online price calculators from
            Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS and Google Cloud Platform. This is a key business requirement as well as it contributes to capacity planning.

            In Azure there are two operating systems you can use and that is Windows or Linux.

            Now we will select what type of Instance our machine will have. A instance is the portion of the
            computer we our renting out so to say. We are inputing how powerful and how much memory the 
             virtual machine will have. We selected a Linux Machine running RHEL using an A2 Instance.

            The price comes down to $101.47 a month for this Virtual Machine. It is cheaped than the Windows default 
            VM because Linux is an Open Source operating system, so it's free!

            Sadly this is not the final price for the VM, Azure requires you to purchase a support package.

            We will try standard. As you can see an extra $100 dollars a month has been added to this package. 
            Leaving it to $237.24 a month or $2,846.88/yr for one machine. A lot more expensive then building 
            your own but, if your goal is to move into cloud, paperless, always has access type of business 
            model then be my guest.
